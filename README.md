Only Everything Lasts Forever is a sound composition containing every sound we can distinguish. It explores the social and political associations of sound representation along with the psychology and philosophy of noise and emptiness.

Hosted here are Java and C++ libraries I've been developing for manipulating logical MP3 frames, along with a written thesis exploring these questions, working towards the completion of an MFA.
