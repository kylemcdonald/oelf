This thesis explores the definition of ``noise'' as ``non-contextual sound''. It defines ``context'' using examples from philosophy, science, and art, examining our ability as observers to misunderstand and misinterpret context. It presents the notion of an ``embedded context'', using examples from the sonic and visual arts. These examples reveal embedded contexts through empty work, glitches, enumeration, and unusual durations. The sound composition ``Only Everything Lasts Forever'' is presented, drawing on all these topics. This composition enumerates all the sounds we can distinguish as humans, as defined by the MP3 digital audio format. The historical and structural aspects of the MP3 format are discussed, along with a technique for enumerating the large space of MP3 in a way that exhibits variation on a human scale.
