	abstract = {A preliminary discussion is presented of recent results obtained as part
of the extension of the Center of Astrophysics redshift survey. Several
features of the results are striking. The distribution of galaxies in
the sample, which contains 1100 galaxies in a 6 deg x 117 deg strip
going through the Coma cluster, looks like a slice through the suds in
the kitchen sink. It appears that the galaxies are on the surfaces of
bubble-like structures with diameters of {25-50/h-Mpc.} The largest bubble
in the survey has a diameter comparable with the most recent estimates
of the diameter of the void in Bootes. This topology poses serious
challenges for current models for the formation of large-scale
structure. The best available model for generating these structures is
the explosive galaxy formation theory of Ostriker and Cowie (1981).},
